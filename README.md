## Expected internship timeline

In order to fast track progress, I aim to complete the 6 courses within 6 weeks, give or take, depending on the length of the modules/courses or the complexity of the lab tasks given.

The expected timeline would then be:

| Course | Expected time | Completed |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Week 1 | :x: |
| AWS | Week 2 | :x: |
| GCP | Week 3 | :x: |
| Docker/Kubernetes | Week 4 | :x: |
| Azure | Week 5 | :x: |
| CI/CD | Week 6 | :x: |

Actual time of completion and order of completion of the submodules/labs may differ, but generally the courses will be completed in this order. (e.g. Some of AWS maybe completed in Week 1, but Linux will still be prioritized to finish first.)
