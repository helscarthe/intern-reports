DevOps Internship report collections

## Expected internship timeline

*Update 25/2/2025, post report 1:* One week will be dedicated to learning exclusively AWS on Udemy. GCP and Azure will take lower priority, focusing first on being able to complete a finished CI/CD workflow on one Cloud provider (AWS).

Expected timeline would then be:

| Course | Expected time | Completed |
|-|-|-|
| [Linux + Ansible/Terraform basics](https://github.com/helscarthe/intern-reports/blob/main/1-linux) | Week 1 | :heavy_check_mark: |
| AWS on Udemy | Week 2 | :x: |
| AWS labs | Week 3 | :x: |
| Docker/Kubernetes | Week 3-4 | :x: |
| CI/CD | Week 4-5 | :x: |
| GCP | Week 5 | :x: |
| Azure | Week 6 | :x: |
